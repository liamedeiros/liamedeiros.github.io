                I am a computational high-energy astrophysicist interested in
                compact objects. I see space as the ultimate laboratory where
                theories can be tested in the most extreme environments
                imaginable, and compact objects are one of the best examples
                of this. I'm currently a NASA Hubble Fellowship Program,
                Einstein Fellow at Princeton University, was a member of the
                Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) from 2019 to 2023, and was
                a National Science Foundation (NSF) Astronomy and Astrophysics
                Postdoctoral Fellow from 2019 to 2022. I am a member of the
                Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) and much of my
                work has focused on preparing for these observations, as well
                as analyzing and interpreting the data. I co-coordinated the
                Gravitational Physics Inputs Working Group within the EHT for
                two and a half years and co-coordinated that working group's

                After the EHT published the first image of the black hole in
                the galaxy M87, I was inspired to develop an algorithm that
                could produce a crisper image. This lead to the development of
                the machine learning based algorithm PRIMO, which is described
                below. We used PRIMO to re-analyze EHT data and produced an
                image that is consistent with the previous EHT image of M87
                and achieves the maximum resolution of the array. The ring
                diameter is consistent with previous publications, but the
                constraint on the ring width is smaller by a factor of two.
                The brightness depression at the center is significantly
                deeper than earlier images. The press release can be found

                  I developed a novel algorithm for interferometric data
                  analysis that uses a large library of high-fidelity general
                  relativistic magnetohydrodynamic plus radiative ray-tracing
                  simulations as a training set.

                  uses dictionary learning to fill in regions of the Fourier
                  domain where the EHT does not observe. PRIMO produces higher
                  resolution images that are free of artifacts, such as the
                  bright "knots" along the ring in both the M87 and Sgr A*

                  1.3 mm wavelength (left) to a PRIMO reconstruction of the
                  image (right). The PRIMO reconstruction is the result of
                  fitting 20 principal components to synthetic data. The data
                  were created by simulating an EHT observation (that mimics
                  the 2017 EHT observations of M87) of the original simulated

                The figure shows the EHT image of the black hole in M87 (left)

                images denote their relative size on the sky as seen from the

                In October 2020, my collaborators and I published a new test
                of gravity using the image of the black hole in M87 (<a
                  href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.141104">article</a>,
                <a

                <a href="https://www.ias.edu/press-releases/2020/eht-gr-test">IAS press release</a>). This work uses the
                measured size and uncertainty of the
                M87 black hole shadow (the shadow that the black hole casts on
                the surrounding emission) to place constraints on deviations
                away from the black hole predicted by general relativity. We
                employ a set of parametrized metrics that deviate from the
                Kerr metric and use both analytic calculations and geodesic
                ray-tracing simulations to place constraints on the deviation
                parameters in these metrics. The simulations used in this
                paper were originally presented in
                <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab8bd1/pdf">Medeiros et al. 2020</a>

                The interactive plots at the bottom of this webpage show how
                the observer's inclination, the black hole's spin, and
                different deviation parameters affect the size and shape of
                the black hole shadow.

                I also explored the use of principal components analysis (PCA)
                to characterize and understand the variability in GRMHD
                simulations and to identify the images that are unusual (or
                outliers) within a set of images. This work was highlighted in

                I am currently a NASA Hubble Fellowship Program, Einstein
                Fellow at Princeton University. Previously, I was member of
                the IAS (2019-2023), and was an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics
                Postdoctoral Fellow 2019-2022. I completed my undergraduate
                education at the University of California-Berkeley in Physics
                and Astrophysics, class of 2013. I then received my Masters
                and PhD (2019) in Physics from the University of
                California-Santa Barbara. After completing my classes in Santa
                Barbara, I took advantage of the flexibility allowed by an NSF
                Graduate Research Fellowship and spent three years at the
                Steward Observatory at The University of Arizona and one year
                at the Black Hole Initiative at Harvard. My PhD thesis was
                completed in collaboration with University of Arizona
                Professors Feryal Özel and Dimitrios Psaltis.

                I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and spent most of my
                childhood living in several cities in Brazil and a few years
                in Cambridge, England. One of the highlights of my career has
                been having the opportunity to engage with the scientific
                community in Brazil. I've given many talks in Brazil to both
                academic and public audiences in both English and Portuguese.
                When I'm not simulating supermassive black holes, I love
                horseback riding, practicing aerial silks, salsa dancing, and
                almost any type of art, especially ceramics and drawing.

                Getting others excited about physics and astronomy is one of
                my favorite things. To me black holes are just about the
                coolest things out there and I love sharing my enthusiasm with
                others. I frequently give public talks and really enjoy
                visiting classrooms. If you would like me to come to your

                  Astrophysical black holes are expected to be described by
                  the Kerr solution to Einstein's equations. Kerr black holes
                  have mass and spin but do not have a charge, astrophysical
                  black holes are not expected to have a significant charge.
                  The size and shape of the black hole shadow of the Kerr
                  black hole will depend on the spin of the black hole and the
                  inclination angle, the angle between the observer's line of
                  sight and the spin axis of the black hole.
